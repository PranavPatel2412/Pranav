    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum
         has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of 
        type and scrambled it to maka type specimen book. It has survived not only five
         centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
         Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
         PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/logo">clickhere</a>
